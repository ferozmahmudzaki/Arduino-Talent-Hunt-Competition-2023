# Arduino-Talent-Hunt-Competition-2023
**Challenge 1 Solutions:
**1. Automated Watering System:
Explore Nishat's innovative solution to automate the irrigation process using Arduino. The repository includes a detailed video demonstration and simulation of the Arduino circuit designs for the automated watering system. The provided materials showcase the code, circuit schematics, and an engaging video explaining the implementation.

Files:

Automated_Watering_System.ino: Arduino code for the automated watering system.
Circuit_Design_Automated_Watering.png: Schematic diagram of the Arduino circuit.
Tinkercad_Simulation_Automated_Watering.mp4: Video demonstration of the Tinkercad simulation.
2. Unauthorized Pump Prevention:
Witness how Nishat tackles the challenge of preventing unauthorized access to the pump. The repository features an Arduino circuit design and code for a security system that triggers a red light and sound when an attempt is made to turn on the pump without authorization. The comprehensive video explains the solution and its simulation.
