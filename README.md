# Arduino-Talent-Hunt-Competition-2023
Challenge 1 Solutions:
1. Automated Watering System:
In this challenge, Nishat successfully automated the watering system by designing an Arduino circuit that monitors soil moisture and controls a submersible pump accordingly. The simulation includes a video demonstrating the Arduino circuit design and code execution using Tinkercad.

Files:

Automated_Watering_System.ino: Arduino code for automated watering system.
Circuit_Design.png: Schematic diagram of the Arduino circuit.
Tinkercad_Simulation.mp4: Video demonstration of the Tinkercad simulation.
2. Unauthorized Pump Prevention:
To prevent unauthorized access to the pump, Nishat implemented a security feature using an Arduino circuit. The simulation video illustrates the design that triggers a red light and sound whenever someone attempts to turn on the pump without authorization.
